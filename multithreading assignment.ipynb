    "**Multithreading in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within the same process. Each thread runs independently and shares the same resources of a process. Python's `threading` module provides a way to create and manage threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Multithreading is Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrency:** Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently. It is particularly useful when dealing with tasks that can be performed simultaneously to improve overall program performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responsiveness:** Multithreading helps in creating responsive applications, ensuring that certain tasks, like user interface interactions, can continue running while other tasks are being executed in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parallelism:** Though Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, multithreading can still be beneficial for I/O-bound tasks, such as network or disk operations, where threads can overlap I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resource Utilization:** Efficient use of resources by utilizing idle time in one thread while other threads are blocked, waiting for I/O or other operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `threading` module provides various functions for working with threads. Here are explanations for three of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`activeCount()`:**\n",
    "   - The `activeCount()` function returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "   - It is often used to monitor the number of active threads in a program.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    print(f\"Active Threads: {threading.activeCount()}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`currentThread()`:**\n",
    "   - The `currentThread()` function returns the current Thread object corresponding to the caller's thread of control.\n",
    "   - It can be used to obtain information about the currently executing thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "    current_thread = threading.currentThread()\n",
    "    print(f\"Current Thread Name: {current_thread.name}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`enumerate()`:**\n",
    "   - The `enumerate()` function returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "   - It is often used to obtain a list of all threads for monitoring or debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "    all_threads = threading.enumerate()\n",

    "Here's an explanation of the `run()`, `start()`, `join()`, and `isAlive()` functions in Python's `threading` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`run()`:**\n",
    "   - The `run()` method is the entry point for the thread's activity. When a thread is created, you can override this method to define the code that will be executed when the thread is started.\n",
    "   - In the `threading.Thread` class, the `run()` method calls the target function passed to the constructor (if any).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "       def run(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_thread = MyThread()\n",
    "   my_thread.run()  # Calls the run method directly\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`start()`:**\n",
    "   - The `start()` method is used to start a thread's activity. It initializes the thread and calls its `run()` method in a separate thread of control.\n",
    "   - It is essential to use `start()` to initiate the thread; calling `run()` directly will execute the code in the same thread, without creating a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "       def run(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_thread = MyThread()\n",
    "   my_thread.start()  # Starts the thread, which calls the run method in a new thread\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`join()`:**\n",
    "   - The `join()` method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. It blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called completes.\n",
    "   - It is often used to ensure that the main program waits for all threads to finish before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       print(\"Thread function is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)\n",
    "   my_thread.start()\n",
    "   my_thread.join()  # Main program waits for the thread to finish\n",
    "   print(\"Main program continues\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`isAlive()`:**\n",
    "   - The `isAlive()` method returns `True` if the thread is still alive (actively executing code), and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "   - It is often used to check whether a thread is still running before proceeding with further actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "   import time\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       time.sleep(2)\n",
    "       print(\"Thread function is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)\n",
    "   my_thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   while my_thread.isAlive():\n",
    "       print(\"Main program is waiting for the thread to finish\")\n",
    "       time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(\"Main program continues\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are fundamental for working with threads in Python, providing the means to define thread behavior (`run()`), start threads (`start()`), synchronize threads (`join()`), and check the status of a thread (`isAlive()`)."

    "### Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrency:**\n",
    "   - Multithreading enables concurrent execution of tasks, allowing multiple threads to run independently. This can lead to improved program performance by leveraging parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responsiveness:**\n",
    "   - Multithreading is beneficial for creating responsive applications. While one thread is performing a time-consuming operation, other threads can continue to run, ensuring that the application remains responsive to user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Utilization:**\n",
    "   - Multithreading allows for efficient use of system resources. Idle time in one thread can be utilized by other threads, especially in scenarios with I/O-bound tasks or tasks involving waiting for external resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modularity and Maintainability:**\n",
    "   - Multithreading facilitates modularity in code design. Different components of a program can be implemented as separate threads, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parallelism for I/O-Bound Tasks:**\n",
    "   - In scenarios where tasks involve waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading from a file, making network requests), multithreading can provide significant performance benefits as threads can overlap these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity and Synchronization:**\n",
    "   - Multithreading introduces complexity to the program, especially when shared resources are involved. Proper synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, or conditions are required to avoid data inconsistencies and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deadlocks and Race Conditions:**\n",
    "   - Poorly managed synchronization can lead to deadlocks (situations where two or more threads are unable to proceed) and race conditions (unexpected outcomes due to unpredictable interleaving of thread execution).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Increased Debugging Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Debugging multithreaded programs can be more challenging than debugging single-threaded programs. Issues related to concurrency may be harder to identify, reproduce, and fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overhead of Thread Creation:**\n",
    "   - Creating and managing threads comes with some overhead. The cost of creating and maintaining threads may outweigh the benefits for certain types of tasks, particularly in scenarios dominated by CPU-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython:**\n",
    "   - In CPython, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the execution of multiple threads in parallel for CPU-bound tasks. This can mitigate the performance advantages of multithreading in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Resource Consumption:**\n",
    "   - Each thread consumes system resources, and having too many threads may lead to increased memory consumption. This can impact the overall performance of the system."

In other words, a deadlock is a state in which each process or thread is waiting for another process or thread to release a resource, preventing all of them from making progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions for Deadlock:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deadlock to occur, the following four conditions, known as the Coffman conditions, must be satisfied simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutual Exclusion:**\n",
    "   - At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode, meaning only one process or thread can use it at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hold and Wait:**\n",
    "   - A process or thread must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes or threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Preemption:**\n",
    "   - Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process or thread; they must be released voluntarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Circular Wait:**\n",
    "   - A circular chain of two or more processes or threads, each waiting for a resource held by the next one in the chain.\n",
